`onto-canon6/data/sumo_plus.db` already existed locally before the ownership
cutover and matched the donor `onto-canon/data/sumo_plus.db` byte-for-byte
(SHA-256 `9a6da4825eb9e4f4d81d1263e5c2ee6847bb85a1b899727e6be929658e1da0f6`).
That made the SUMO migration a contract cutover, not a rebuild project.

Archive-readiness should be verified from an isolated temp copy of the repo,
not inferred from the main workspace. `make verify-setup`, `make smoke`, and
`make check` all passed from `/tmp/onto-canon6-isolation.*` with no sibling
`onto-canon5` or `onto-canon` repos present.
