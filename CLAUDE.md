# onto-canon6

`onto-canon6` is the successor bootstrap for the `onto-canon` lineage. It
starts from a proved slice instead of trying to port the entire previous
runtime.

4. `docs/plans/0001_successor_roadmap.md`
5. `docs/plans/0005_v1_capability_parity_matrix.md`

## Commands

```bash
pytest -q

## Current State

- Phases 0-15 completed the bootstrap roadmap, not full successor parity.
- The explicit parity ledger is `docs/plans/0005_v1_capability_parity_matrix.md`.
- Two real non-fixture runs completed (PSYOP Stage 1 + Shield AI WhyGame).
- **Progressive extraction pipeline** (Plan 0018) is complete and proven on real
  text. 3-pass architecture: open extraction → predicate mapping (78% early exit)
  → entity refinement. 87.8% predicate resolution on Shield AI findings.
- ADRs 0017-0019 adopted: permissive extraction, progressive disclosure,
  ancestor-aware evaluation.
- Predicate Canon bridge and ancestor-aware evaluator operational.

## Working Rules

- Use the recorded friction from real runs before reopening broad parity chasing
  or another roadmap extension.
- Keep the current scope narrow and explicit: reviewed assertions, overlays,
  promoted graph state, stable identity, semantic canonicalization, and the thin
  CLI/MCP surfaces that prove those slices.
- If the next change cannot be justified against the adopted ADR set, it should
  not land as casual repo drift.

## LLM Integration

- All LLM calls route through `llm_client` with mandatory `task=`, `trace_id=`,
  `max_budget=` kwargs.
- Prompts are YAML/Jinja2 templates in `prompts/`, loaded via
  `llm_client.render_prompt()`. No f-string prompts in Python.
- Prompt/model iteration should use `ExtractionPromptExperimentService`
  (`evaluation/prompt_eval_service.py`) backed by `prompt_eval`, not ad hoc
  local loops. Results log to llm_client observability (SQLite + JSONL).
- Extraction config, prompt refs, and variant definitions are in
  `config/config.yaml`.
- No examples in prompts without approval. Rules and goal-oriented guidance
  are fine.
